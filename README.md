# Steering-p5js
steer particles using mouse pointer 

this is impelmenting Coding Challenge [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4)
, it extract font path points from text in p5.js with p5.Font.textToPoints(). then render the text as particles with steering behaviors that react to the mouse.

## changes I made 
 - chasing mouse behavior 
 - change color to random if it's not it's position
